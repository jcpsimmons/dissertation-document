<p class="itemTitle">Introduction</p>
<p class="itemText">Virtual reality is currently experiencing a massive resurgence in popularity. Dominant competitors in the market offer hardware at consumer attainable price points that continue a downward trend. The descent of hardware pricing and rapid innovation on the part of VR hardware manufacturers suggest that head-mounted VR has finally poised itself for mass adoption — something it failed to do during previous waves of VR popularity throughout the last few decades.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">The Postmodal Era</p>
<p class="itemText">The field of computer music is mutating rapidly. The current rate of change, and dissolution of boundaries suggests that it, along with other related disciplines, will cease to exist solidly as individual entities, and instead integrate into a seamless, nonlinear continuum. In the relatively short time that I have been composing computer music I have observed a massive increase in the acceptance of multimedia works into national and international conferences. As an artist working in multiple med...</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Summary</p>
<p class="itemText">The genre-lineage of computer music is fluid, technologically reinventing itself, and highly concerned with the prescriptivism set about by the creation tools used by the artist. Faced with a plethora of new post-computer tools, the computer music community is now seeking a new direction for development, but this path is not as clear of a next step as it has been in the past. Kim Cascone, in his paper The Aesthetics of Failure: "Post-Digital" Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music writes a ca...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Importance for Artists</p>
<p class="itemText">In addition to outlining the influence of the commercial sector on modern research in this field, the workshop description highlights the fundamental challenge facing artists working in VR coming from computer music fields:</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, most modern VR systems impart an ancillary role to audio, where sounds serve to amplify visual immersion. It is up to sound and music researchers to elaborate ways in which we can think natively about VR audio, and define the role of sound in the ultimate displays of...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Defining Postmodal</p>
<p class="itemText">Postmodal is the term that contextualizes my larger body of research. It is necessary to sufficiently define this term to discuss my specific work in integrating audio and virtual reality. Before defining postmodality, one must define what it is not. Postmodality is not the same term as multimedia, although multimedia art can be under the umbrella of postmodality. Multimedia art is, by its most simple definition, artwork that employs the use of two or more mediums. The term multimedia says nothi...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">How to Proceed</p>
<p class="itemText">Approaching this kind of postmodal development without any kind of formal framework. I found it helpful to think about the design process both before creating the work and during the development phase. The question that was continuously at the back of my mind during the development process was “What is music’s unique contribution to virtual reality?”</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I sourced my research extremely widely. When doing research on art that exists outside of a strict medium, it made sense to source from a wide rang...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Lineage</p>
<p class="itemText">Before branching out it is advantageous to look for historical manifestations of postmodal art. A notable early example of historical postmodal art is the operatic work of Ricard Wagner.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let us therefore first agree as to whom we must consider the creator of the Art-work of the Future; so that we may argue back from him to the life-conditions which alone can permit his art-work and himself to take their rise.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Who, then, will be the Artist of the Future?</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Without a doubt, the Poet.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Summary</p>
<p class="itemText">To successfully design a postmodal work with a musical basis, I first defined the scope of my project. I subsequently considered which mediums might feed into the work. The bounds of the work were defined as follows: the work would be for the VR head mounted display, the system would generate a virtual world based on real-time audio input, the audio input could come from a musician wearing the headset and concurrently playing a musical instrument, or the user could stream music from whatever sou...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Real Time Whenever Possible</p>
<p class="itemText">This rule holds true on two different levels of development for the platform. Firstly, the environment must respond in real time to the user. This real time responsiveness invites users to play and interact as if the environment was a living thing. Overuse of fixed media on such a dynamic platform creates an experience that is stale for the user. An overly fixed environment allows a user to feel as though they are in the scene, but the lack of interaction creates a sense of being separated from ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">VR Musical Instruments</p>
<p class="itemText">A small amount of research has already been conducted by computer musicians in this domain. Serafin et al. in their paper VR Musical Instruments: State of the Art, Design Principles, and Future Directions propose that the computer musician designing for virtual reality “make use of existing skills”.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Video Games</p>
<p class="itemText">Video games are projected to fuel development on the VR platform in the coming years (Intelligence 2015; Research 2017; Gaudiosi 2016). Creators can act in one of two ways in response to this information: rejection, or acceptance. Ignorance of this fact by computer music scholars interested in branching out into this platform risks creation of uninformed works. Acceptance of this trend opens a massive stream of information that computer musicians can implement in their own works. Concepts presen...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Game Studies</p>
<p class="itemText">Although there is a lot of new research into the VR field from the perspective of computer music, there already exists an entire lineage of research into VR specific technology, and more broadly the game mechanics employed in these spaces. Game studies programs are more widely established, and generally accepted in academic circles than they were 15 years ago. Some more forward thinking institutions have even gone so far as to offer scholarships for students that play video games competitively (...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Science Fiction</p>
<p class="itemText">When designing for any new technological medium, it is advantageous to look towards the writings of science fiction writers. Science fiction writings contain a wealth of insightful information about VR. The ideal sci-fi author to study has an established track record of reasonably correct predictions and creates concepts that are inspiring to the reader. William Gibson meets both criteria in the field of VR. Gibson's work Neuromancer (W. F. Gibson 1997) is the seminal work of the cyberpunk genre...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Lanier, VPL, and Silicon Valley Culture</p>
<p class="itemText">Any writing on virtual reality must necessarily encompass thoughts in many different disciplines. Author, father of virtual reality, and entrepreneur Jaron Lanier serves as a connection point between many disparate disciplines. Jaron’s foray into virtual reality began with his first company VPL Research. The "VPL" in VPL Research stands for "Virtual Programming Languages". Despite the company being most known for devices such as the DataGlove and the EyePhone, its original impetus was to create ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Psychedelic Drugs</p>
<p class="itemText">The connection between psychedelic drugs and VR is undeniable, but often, if not completely ignored in academic literature. A full account of the possibilities for VR development must include this connection. This link has been made known at various points throughout the history of VR. Douglas Rushkoff's 1994 field report on cyberpunk culture Cyberia (Rushkoff 1994) is a notable account of this. In this work, he interviews programmer Marc de Groot:</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText">The collective unconscious, “does not derive from personal experience and is not a personal acquisition but is inborn.” (Jung and Hull 1981, 3). This is what McKenna implies with his use of the term ”Gaian mind”. This can be deduced from other mentions of concepts related to the Jungian collective unconscious, such as, “[Psychedelics] cause us to connect and reconnect the contents of the collective mind in ever more implausible, beautiful, and self-fulfilling ways .” (McKenna 1993, 130).

A story can begin at any point in this cycle, and the cycle can, and often does play out on many time and magnitude scales. Typically, a story begins at the 12 o’clock position of the graphic and progresses in counterclockwise fashion. A call to adventure is foisted upon the hero. The hero acquires one or more helpers. There is a threshold crossing that can manifest in many forms, some commonly used ones such as the night-sea ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Monomyth: Summary</p>
<p class="itemText">What follows is a brief summary of Campbell’s monomyth as it applies to the postmodal artist. In Campbell’s most detailed work on monomyth, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, he details 17 potential mythemes that fit under three larger gestures that make up the monomyth. In my description of how this concept applies to postmodal artistic creation, I have narrowed the 17 components down to only the most relevant. The three larger gestures which have already been detailed in this writing by different...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Departure</p>
<p class="itemText">The artist must start somewhere. Any artist that has been creating for some time realizes that one of the hardest parts of the creative process is getting started. Oftentimes, genuine creativity arises for the artist when he makes a mistake that leads him into uncharted territory. “A blunder—apparently the merest chance—reveals an unsuspected world, and the individual is drawn into a relationship with forces that are not rightly understood.” (Campbell 2008, 42). Regardless of if the artist begin...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Initiation</p>
<p class="itemText">The artist enters the world of the unknown, where he will be tested through a series of trials. Here the artist may be aided by advice or wisdom imparted by the protective figure he may have encountered during the departure phase. These trials for the artist can range from the trivial to the severe. Things such as computer problems or running out of art supplies could be seen in the vaguest sense as minor trials. More significant trials have notably been encountered by many artists—the fact that...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Return</p>
<p class="itemText">Ceremoniously or unceremoniously, the artist finishes their work, or performance, and subsequently returns to the ordinary world. This ordinary world in artistic terms, could include interacting with the audience after a live performance, or releasing an album—in any of these cases, it is the point when the work largely leaves the control of the artist, or when the artist returns from the creative role. Ostensibly the artist brings something of value, an elixir back to the community. This elixir...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Case Studies</p>
<p class="itemText">I utilized the framework most succinctly put by Campbell in my development of the audio responsive VR environment Spektra. I found Campbell’s framework to be particularly useful when foraying into this mostly foreign and uncharted territory of development. Virtual reality, as explained throughout this writing, has a lineage, a set of preconceived notions and “best practices”, but at its current state offers to wipe the slate clean again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Development Pipeline</p>
<p class="itemText">At this point, the OSC data import problem, and local audio routing problem were both solved and development on a usable version of Spektra could formally commence. The development pipeline progressed in this manner: I would make rough paper sketches for a scene to be integrated into Spektra. I would then work on the 3D art for the scene and import it as discrete game objects into the Unity engine. After creating the static scene, Micchelli and I would brainstorm mappings to be made between audi...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Findings</p>
<p class="itemText">Outside of in-lab testing, Spektra was showcased publicly as part of a large-scale multimedia work titled MKUltra: Form Constant. The full work was presented in the xMPL performance space at the University of California Irvine. The Spektra apparatus was set up next to the performance area. Spectators could wander the space freely during the performance and put on the VR headset to experience Spektra in real time as it reacted to the live musical performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p></p>

<p class="itemText">A few main design challenges became evident after the presentation of MKUltra: Form Constant. These challenges arose from my own critical view of the performance, audience feedback, and committee insights. The main challenges were as follows:</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Simplify.</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Integrate music in a more dynamic capacity.</span></p></p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Simplify</p>
<p class="itemText"> Many participants seemed to be very confused about how to approach the MKUltra performance. As the art director of all technology and mediums being used in the performance, this insight personally eluded me until several months after the performance had occurred. Viewing the project through a less technologically encumbered lens I was able to understand how the polydirectional nature of the work could have confused participants. Walking into the space was itself overwhelming. The participant wo...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Integrate Music</p>
<p class="itemText">In MKUltra the improvised synthesizer music dynamically affected what the VR-wearer saw in the headset. In the revised performance, titled Abstruse, I wanted to more clearly link the two mediums. In MKUltra the synthesizer music fit within the aesthetic that I was composing in at the time - heavily beat and drone based electronic music. In order to more closely mesh VR with the music, either the VR simulation, or the music would have to be modified. Due to the degree-focus being on music, and th...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Emphasize Postmodality</p>
<p class="itemText">The concept of postmodality was at the core of MKUltra although it was not commonly understood by participants. Paring down the mediums used for Abstruse would help to more clearly communicate this concept, however I felt as though to make it abundantly clear I needed higher order integration of VR and audio. MKUltra featured lower order integration of many different mediums, briefly put, many mediums emerging from the same conceptual starter. Abstruse would attempt the opposite strategy: just t...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Synthesis of Elements</p>
<p class="itemText">Apart from the three design principles already laid out, a more overarching principle emerged during the development process. The main driving purpose of Abstruse was to test the theories presented in my research. Many pieces of tangential knowledge were acquired along the writing and production process, but the core theory that Abstruse would serve to illustrate was that of postmodality. As an artist, this divide between aesthetically true artwork, and technological exercise presented me with a...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Findings</p>
<p class="itemText">Over the course of my research in conceptualizing, developing, and deploying music-first VR software, many different conclusions, major and minor emerged. The two that best sum up the research are the audiovisual connection, and a new way of considering the use of medium.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Audiovisual Connections</p>
<p class="itemText">Despite only two mediums being present in my research, i.e. music and VR, a third element, user interaction, emerged as an important additional area of research. Due primarily to the technical overhead necessary to create content in VR, it was clear that the VR environment should dictate initial considerations in the music and in the user interaction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Medium is the Message, Again</p>
<p class="itemText">At a very early conceptual stage of this work, the work of media theorist Marshall McLuhan seemed as though it would provide a strong basis for my own research. McLuhan became a distant memory, but in writing this conclusion it has re-emerged with renewed value. While not central to this dissertation, future investigation on how relevance of message changes dynamically with the increase in the number of mediums included in a postmodal work would be of interest.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Towards Postmodality</p>
<p class="itemText">It is possible that the high degree of current private sector investment in VR technologies will be the main driving force in galvanizing a movement towards the postmodal. Across universities, there remains a degree confusion of about how to successfully embrace a more postmodal approach to artistic creation without completely abandoning a traditional delineation between mediums and disciplines. There are a growing number of programs at academic institutions that identify themselves with descrip...</p>
