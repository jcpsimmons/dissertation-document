\f0\fs24 \cf0 Ceremoniously or unceremoniously, the artist finishes their work, or performance, and subsequently returns to the ordinary world. This ordinary world in artistic terms, could include interacting with the audience after a live performance, or releasing an album\'97in any of these cases, it is the point when the work largely leaves the control of the artist, or when the artist returns from the creative role. Ostensibly the artist brings something of value, an elixir back to the community. This elixir renews and reinvigorates the community that receives it, even if it is bitter medicine. \
Of course, the artist can also refuse the responsibility of returning. \'93Even the Buddha, after his triumph, doubted whether the message of realization could be communicated, and saints are reported to have passed away while in the supernal ecstasy.\'94 (Campbell 2008, 167)\
