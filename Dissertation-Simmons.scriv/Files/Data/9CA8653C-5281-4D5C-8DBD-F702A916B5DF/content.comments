\f0\fs24 \cf0 Wagner illustrated this through his concept of gesamtkuntswerk where one auteur oversaw the production and integration of all artistic elements around a core story. In modern times, this concept is still present, yet different, due to the ability for the auteur to not only have creative control, but to also have an increasing ability to use the tools for production without the aid of others.}]]></Comment>
