\f0\fs24 \cf0 What follows is a brief summary of Campbell\'92s monomyth as it applies to the postmodal artist. In Campbell\'92s most detailed work on monomyth, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, he details 17 potential mythemes that fit under three larger gestures that make up the monomyth. In my description of how this concept applies to postmodal artistic creation, I have narrowed the 17 components down to only the most relevant. The three larger gestures which have already been detailed in this writing by different terminology are Departure, Initiation, and Return in Campbell\'92s parlance. \
