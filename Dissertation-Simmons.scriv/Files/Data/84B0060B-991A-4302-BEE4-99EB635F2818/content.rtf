\f0\fs24 \cf0 Over the course of my research in conceptualizing, developing, and deploying music-first VR software, many different conclusions, major and minor emerged. The three that best sum up the research are presented in this conclusion. The trajectory I have taken in conveying this information begins at the micro level, and gradually move outwards. Firstly I discuss the musical implications of this work. Secondly I discuss some of the medium-specific considerations that the artist must be aware of when putting together a multimodal work. Finally I explain the implications that this kind of research has in terms of a new postmodal field of research.}
