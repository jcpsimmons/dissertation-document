\f0\fs24 \cf0 It is possible that the high degree of current private sector investment in VR technologies will be the main driving force in galvanizing a movement towards the postmodal. Across universities, there remains a degree confusion of about how to successfully embrace a more postmodal approach to artistic creation without completely abandoning a traditional delineation between mediums and disciplines. There are a growing number of programs at academic institutions that identify themselves with descriptors such as \'93multimedia art\'94, \'93experimental media\'94, etc. However, these programs seem to emphasize adoption of one or more mediums instead of seeing the whole range of mediums as a continuum. It is my hope that these disciplines will continue to look across traditional intermedium divisions while still placing its highest values on artistry, not falling prey to temptations induced by the cultural dominance of technology in our contemporary times.}
