Hi all - I decided to make public my dissertation documents so you can see how they are revised over time. I plan on releasing an unedited, unabridged version as a book at some point. 

There are two main files here. Usually a PDF export that's a pretty-recent version of the document, this is good for reading.

There's also a .scrv folder that contains all of the files I use in Scrivener when writing.

Anyways, happy reading - questions/comments reach out at jcpsimmons@gmail.com
